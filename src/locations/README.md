Note that the YAML databases may be in very improper structure/format. It ignored the following

1 - Orientations
2 - If the position/orientation(when added) needed is for arrival or departure from said location
-------------------

This just to simplify and speed up the development of the CRUD functionality within the admin panel.
Later we could improve this if needed.
